Linking phenology and temperature at Ordway Swisher Biological Station

Aim
This project looks at (air) temperature and phenology at Ordway Swisher Biological Station (OSBS) in Florida. It aimed to show a relationship between temperatures and phenology observations (needles, open pollen cones), primarily to identify temperatures and times at which pollen present in the area.
